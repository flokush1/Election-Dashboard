## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v16+ (for frontend)
- **Python** 3.8+ (for ML backend)
- **npm** or **yarn** (package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flokush1/Election-Dashboard.git
   cd Election-Dashboard
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors pandas numpy scikit-learn openpyxl werkzeug
   
   # Optional: For PyTorch models
   pip install torch
   ```

4. **Start the ML backend server:**
   ```bash
   python model_api.py
   ```
   The API will run on `http://localhost:5000`

5. **Start the frontend development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The dashboard will open at `http://localhost:3000`

### Data Setup

The application expects data files in specific locations:
- Place Excel voter data in `VoterID_Data_Assembly/` folder
- Place GeoJSON boundary files in `public/data/` folder
- Parliament data: `NewDelhi_Parliamentary_Data.xlsx`
- Prediction CSVs: `predictions_*.csv`

Note: Large data files (`.xlsx`, `.pkl`) are gitignored. You'll need to obtain these separately.

### Input Features
- Demographics: Age, Gender, Religion, Caste
- Economic: Income level, Land rates, Construction costs
- Geographic: Locality, Assembly, Ward, Booth
- Family: Family size, relationships, household structure

### Output
- Party probabilities (BJP, Congress, AAP, Others, NOTA)
- Turnout probability (0-100%)
- Confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- Alignment category (Core/Leaning/Swing)

### Model Training
Models are trained on historical election data with features extracted from:
- Voter rolls with demographic annotations
- Economic survey data
- Geographic information systems (GIS)
- Historical voting patterns

## 📊 Data Sources

This project analyzes electoral data from:
- **Election Commission of India** - Voter rolls and booth information
